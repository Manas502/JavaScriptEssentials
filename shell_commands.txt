A filesystem organizes a computerâ€™s files and directories into a tree structure. 
It starts with the root directory. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.


From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

1.pwd outputs the name of the current working directory.

2.ls lists all files and directories in the working directory.

3.cd switches you into the directory you specify.

4.mkdir creates a new directory in the working directory.

5.touch creates a new file inside the working directory.
