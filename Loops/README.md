## Loops

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

It's something like a game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed in loop as:

```
for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}
```
